# public projects
 
 ## This repository will have all my projects
 the projects displayed in this repository will have it's own folder, inside of which, will have 2 files:
 -one of them (.exe) will be a executable file to run the code 
 -the second one is the code itself, so if you wish to look at the code, it will be at display

### How to use?
to use the '.exe' file, you need to download it, then you just simply click it to execute

#### I HOPE YOU ENJOY MY CONTENT

##### WARNING: the '.exe' file, only works in windows machine.
as of the moment, i'm working to make a executable file for linux.
