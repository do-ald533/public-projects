 ## This repository will have all my projects
 the projects displayed in this repository will have it's own folder, inside of which, will have 2 files:
 
-one of them (.exe) will be a executable file to run the code 
 
-the second one is the code itself, so if you wish to look at the code, it will be at display

### How to use?
to use the '.exe' file, you need to download it, then you just simply click it to execute on the location you downloaded it
