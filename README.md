 # Welcome :grinning:
 ## This repository will have all my projects
 the projects displayed in this repository will have it's own folder, where inside of each, will have 2 files:
 
- One of them a  `.exe` file which is the file to execute the program. 
    - **Note**:The `.exe` file only works on the windows OS.
 
- The second one is the code itself, so if you wish to look at the code, it will be at display.

---

### How to use?
- (*Windows*) To execute the program, you need to download the .exe file, then use the file explorer to navigate were the file was downloaded, then just simply double click on the file.
    - Note: The windows defender will not let you execute the file, to execute it press in *more information*,then click *execute anyway*.


- (*Linux*) To use the linux executable first you need to download the .`py` file, after this step is complete, use the terminal to navigate to the folder were the .`py` file was downloaded, then just simply type: `./file-name.py`
